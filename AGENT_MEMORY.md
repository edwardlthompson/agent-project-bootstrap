## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Platform | Multi-stack template (Web, Python, Android, Node, optional Lightroom/Rust/Go) | 1.0.0 | Template maintainer repo |
| License | MIT | - | Pure FOSS |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases + GitHub Pages demo | - | F-Droid/Winget stubs for child repos |
## Active Modules

- ✅ Web / PWA (`modules/web/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Python (`modules/python/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Android / F-Droid (`modules/android/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Node API (`modules/node/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Lightroom Classic (`modules/lightroom/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Rust (`modules/rust/MODULE.md`)
- ✅ Go (`modules/go/MODULE.md`)

## Threat Model Checklist

- ✅ `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` drafted (STRIDE, trust boundaries, top abuse cases, OWASP LLM Top 10 walk)
- ✅ No proprietary closed-source SDKs in production path
- ✅ Opt-in only telemetry (GDPR/CCPA compliant); see `docs/PRIVACY.md`
- ✅ Secrets excluded from VCS (Gitleaks pre-commit)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning enabled (local `update-deps --audit` + CodeQL + Trivy + Dependabot backup)
- ✅ Input validation at all data boundaries
- ✅ `SECURITY.md` and private vulnerability reporting enabled

## Persistent Context

### Project Purpose

FOSS coding-agent bootstrap template: labeled BUILD_PLAN sprints, Golden Path examples, CI guardrails, workspace memory, and design-system cohesion across Web and Android.

### Key Constraints

- Max 300 lines per static data file (UI + i18n), 150 lines per pure logic file
- Trunk-based development with Conventional Commits
- Strict type safety and test coverage budgets

### First-run agent

Cline is the first-run agent in Cursor: GitHub sign-in, FREE models, no API keys (no OPENAI_API_KEY and no Codex CLI on the first-time path). Codex remains optional advanced review only (`/codex-review`) and is not part of onboarding, `/tour`, `/prerelease`, or `/ship`.

Golden Path Settings/About/Feedback are a route stack, not three booleans. Web History API and Android BackHandler pop one level; at home Back stays in the app. Persist key `gp.nav.v1` restores location after theme/crash/share-target (web) and rotation/process death (Android).

## Session Retrospectives

| 2026-09-01 | M47 Cline-first + GP nav | Cline first-run (no keys); web History + Android BackHandler pop one route; persist gp.nav.v1 | Do not put Codex on /tour /prerelease /ship; device Back smoke is [ADB] |
| 2026-08-28 | v1.0.0 /ship | Cloud agent #81 reviewed+merged; RP #82 cut first stable; Unreleased empty; SBOM+OpenVEX on the tag | Do not merge RP while upgrade-sim still fails on pruned stacks; `Release-As: 1.0.0` beats 0.26.0 |
| 2026-08-28 | /cleanup HUMAN leftovers | Archived 5 script-closed HUMAN rows; CII, Ollama, Android SDK stay 🔲 | Recurring weekly AUTO stays 🔲 |
| 2026-08-28 | HUMAN leftover automation | Scripts close Scorecard, crash-proxy-off, mcp.json copy, weekly Dependabot, CODEOWNERS | CII login, Ollama install, and Android licenses stay HUMAN/ADB |

| 2026-08-27 | /build scoped gates | Per-row `--scope auto`; failed-stack `--skip-preamble` retry; `/gates` wrap-up stays full | Do not treat docs-only as a skip of Sprint wrap-up `/gates` |
| 2026-08-27 | /build M46 P0 | Force-push deny; go/cargo PATH; System32 bash; Sacred upgrade sim; plugin version; GP JSON schemas | Next: Node/Python About+crash; do not treat /push as force-push approval |
