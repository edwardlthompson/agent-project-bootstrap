## Entries

### 2026-07-12 — Pre-release gate Dependabot counter + FOSS MCP check
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** `/push` pre-release `--strict` failed: Dependabot alerts API used unsupported `page=` form; FOSS integrations check failed whenever gitignored `.cursor/mcp.json` existed locally
- **Decision:** Count alerts via `gh api --paginate` query string; treat live `mcp.json` as OK unless `git ls-files` shows it tracked; multi-stack `--strict` skips missing optional toolchains
- **Alternatives considered:** Require `security_events` refresh always (rejected: false failures blocked release); ban local MCP (rejected: contradicts CURSOR_INTEGRATIONS activation)
- **Consequences:** Maintainer gates pass with local MCP enabled; Release Please #36 published v0.14.1

_Seed template ADR: `docs/adr/0000-template-baseline.md`. Child repos use `docs/adr/0001-core-architecture.md`._

### 2026-07-12 — Dependabot automerge CI gap (M32)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Merges via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`app/github-actions`) do not start `push` workflows; `main` tip after Dependabot merges had zero CI runs; weekly health failed waiting for missing runs
- **Decision:** Prefer optional `AUTOMERGE_TOKEN` PAT for Dependabot/Release Please merge; add `workflow_dispatch` to CodeQL + Security Scan; `check-github-ci.sh --dispatch-if-missing` (weekly health uses it with `actions: write`); prefer Git Bash in `agent-run.py` on Windows
- **Alternatives considered:** Require PAT only (rejected: blocks FOSS template without secrets); SHA-pin all actions for Scorecard (deferred: conflicts with documented `@vX.Y.Z` policy)
- **Consequences:** Weekly health can self-heal missing runs; post-merge CI still needs HUMAN required-status-checks + optional PAT for true push triggers

### 2026-07-02 — Quiet agent shell (hooks Python + agent-run)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Cursor Agent shell execution opened `.sh` hook and script tabs, stealing editor focus while users typed
- **Decision:** Migrate hooks to Python; add `scripts/agent-run.py` for agent gate invocations; ship `.vscode/settings.json` anti-reveal defaults; document KB-010
- **Alternatives considered:** Disable hooks globally (rejected: loses destructive-op guard); rewrite all scripts to PowerShell (rejected: scope); `pythonw.exe` for hooks (rejected: breaks stdout JSON)
- **Consequences:** Agent-facing commands no longer contain `.sh` paths; underlying bash scripts unchanged for CI/humans

### 2026-07-01 — Cursor hook smoke isolation (M31)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** M31 audit found `check-cursor-hooks.sh --smoke` false-pass when `.cursor-session-state.json` already listed `git push` in `destructive_ops_approved`
- **Decision:** Smoke test clears session approvals before deny assertion; validate hook scripts require shebang on line 1
- **Alternatives considered:** Ignore local session state in smoke (rejected: hides real deny-path bugs); require empty session file (rejected: breaks dev workflow)
- **Consequences:** `--smoke` is deterministic in CI and locally; invalid hook scripts fail validate-bootstrap early

### 2026-06-30 — Cursor hooks as enforcement layer (M30)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** M27 rejected `beforeSubmitPrompt` hooks; rules alone cannot block destructive shell commands at runtime
- **Decision:** Ship FOSS-safe project hooks (`beforeShellExecution`, `afterFileEdit`, `subagentStart`, `sessionStart`, `beforeMCPExecution`); fail-open guards; session `destructive_ops_approved` for `/push`/`/ship`; opt-out via `<!-- cursor-hooks: off -->`
- **Alternatives considered:** Prompt-rewrite hooks (rejected per M27); broad shell blocklists (rejected: blocks legitimate agent work)
- **Consequences:** `check-cursor-hooks.sh --smoke` in validate-bootstrap; complements `destructive-ops.mdc` without token bloat

### 2026-06-20 — Repo-wide checklist status markers
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** BUILD_PLAN and scattered checklists used mixed ⬜ / `- [ ]` / ✅ formats; inconsistent in Markdown Preview vs source
- **Decision:** Standardize on 🔲 open · ✅ done · ❌ blocked emoji markers repo-wide; document in `BUILD_PLAN.md` legend and agent read order
- **Alternatives considered:** GitHub `- [ ]` task lists (rejected: poor Preview readability and agent parsing); keep ⬜ white square (rejected: visually similar to ✅ in some fonts)
- **Consequences:** All new checklist rows use emoji; `agent-progress.sh` accepts legacy ⬜ for child repos during transition

### 2026-06-18 — Release automation hardening (M29)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** v0.11.0 release lacked SBOM assets (GITHUB_TOKEN cannot chain `release` → `release.yml`); Release Please skipped `extra-files`; `health-check.yml` registered as path name caused 0-job push failures
- **Decision:** `release-please.yml` runs `sync-template-version.sh` on release PR branches and dispatches `release.yml` on `release_created`; rename workflow to `weekly-health-check.yml`; fix sync script for Windows Git Bash
- **Alternatives considered:** PAT with workflow scope for release chaining (rejected: secrets management); manual SBOM backfill only (rejected: repeated human step each release)
- **Consequences:** Release Please needs `actions: write`; future releases should ship SBOM assets without manual dispatch

### 2026-06-17 — Batch instruction templates (M27)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Agents and child-repo owners needed repeatable shortcuts for bootstrap, verify, build, ship, and maintenance workflows without re-pasting long prompts
- **Decision:** Ship 25 slash commands in `.cursor/commands/` (20 atomic + 5 super), bare-word expansion via `batch-commands.mdc`, human cheat sheet at `docs/help/BATCH_COMMANDS.md`, registry at `docs/BATCH_COMMANDS.md`; `/push` and `/ship` grant explicit push approval
- **Alternatives considered:** `beforeSubmitPrompt` hook for bare words (rejected: Cursor API cannot rewrite prompts); single mega-doc for humans and agents (rejected: overwhelms first-time users)
- **Consequences:** `alwaysApply` rule adds ~25 lines per session; `check-batch-commands.sh` prevents registry drift; child repos cherry-pick via `UPGRADING_FROM_TEMPLATE.md`

### 2026-06-30 — Autonomous /build with grouped human section
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** `/build` halted on HUMAN/ADB rows; humans needed a single review block after automation; child repos need scripted attempts before manual follow-up
- **Decision:** Add `build-sprint-status.sh`, `attempt-build-plan-row.sh`, and `HUMAN_BACKLOG.md` (failure-only); restructure BUILD_PLAN with `#### Human & device (after automation)`; AGENT/AUTO runs first, then automation attempts on grouped human rows
- **Alternatives considered:** Skip human rows entirely during /build (rejected: loses automation catalog value); keep human rows interleaved in Sequential (rejected: hard to review after automation)
- **Consequences:** Child repos must place HUMAN/ADB rows in the grouped section; `<!-- no-auto-approve -->` disables autonomous ADR ack

### 2026-06-13 — @lhci/cli npm overrides for transitive CVEs
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Lighthouse CI (`@lhci/cli`) bundles transitive dependencies (`tmp`, `uuid`) with known CVEs; no patched `@lhci/cli` release available at triage time
- **Decision:** Add npm `overrides` in `examples/web/package.json` forcing `tmp >= 0.2.6` and `uuid >= 11.1.1`; document in KB-007
- **Alternatives considered:** Dismiss Dependabot alert (rejected: hides real risk); remove Lighthouse CI job (rejected: loses performance gate)
- **Consequences:** Lockfile must be regenerated after override changes; overrides should be removed when `@lhci/cli` ships fixed dependencies

### 2026-06-13 — Ship all optional ecosystem modules (M3)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Sprint M3 asked whether to ship Lightroom, Rust, and Go optional modules in the template maintainer repo
- **Decision:** Ship all three with Golden Path stubs, MODULE.md guides, and path-gated CI jobs (`lightroom`, `rust`, `go`) that skip when child repos remove the directories
- **Alternatives considered:** Lightroom-only (rejected: Rust/Go stubs are low-cost and popular); defer all optional modules (rejected: COMPLETED_TASKS M3 work already landed)
- **Consequences:** Template CI runs more jobs on `main`; child repos can delete unused `examples/` folders to skip jobs via `hashFiles` guards
